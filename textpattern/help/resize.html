	<h3>Image Size</h3>	
	
	<p>Two images are automatically created from the uploaded original which is always kept and from which future resizings are made:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A regular size image. The size of this will be automatically the same as 
		the last image that was uploaded or resized. If the image is rectangular then 
		the longest side will be the same as the longest side of the previously handled 
		image. It is also possible to force each image to be the same height or width by
		checkmarking either the width or the height field.<br/>
		
		<img src="images/resize.jpg" style="margin-top: 5px" alt="resize button" width="124" height="26" border="0" />
		</li>
		
		<li>A thumbnail image can also be cropped to a square (from the left, middle 
		or right) or left whole.</li>
	</ul>
